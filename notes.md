### Layered Architecture (monolith) => image skyscraper

+ strict coupling
+ Hidden dependencies
+ Only way is up

### Service Oriented Architecture

### Microkernel Architecture

### Microservice Architecture

Pros:
+ Loose Coupling
+ Clear Separation of Concerns

Cons:
+ Orchestration


# Frontend Architecture

### Microservices Architecture

+ Frontend becomes a service amongst many
+ does have another status though
+ more responsibilities
+ i.e. it needs an architecture of its own


+ Separate service
+ Asynchronous Coupling
