"Lisp isn’t a language, it’s a building material." —Alan Kay.

"Architecture is not based on concrete and steel, and the elements of the soil. It's based on wonder." -Daniel Libeskind

<!---
+ Actual Architects tend to do the exact opposite.
+ To them, its more about the lived spaces rather than the construction.

## Conclusion

Engineering is not a science. Science studies particular events to find general laws. Engineering design makes use of the laws to solve particular practical problems. In this it is more closely related to art or craft. –Ove Arup
